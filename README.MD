# Algorithms-DataStructure

This project consist of different Pattern Matching algorithmn their time complexity and their comparision

#Description
This project is coded in java.

# Usage
In order to run this application you must do the following things installed on your machine:

    -Java 
    -IDE to run your application (preferably Eclipse).

#Problem Statement:
    
    For this assignment, we have implemented the following pattern matching algorithms given below.

        Brute-Force algorithm
        Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm
        Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm
        
    Experiment:

        Compareed three algorithms for several different input text and patterns; 10 different cases
        Mentioned the number of comparisons required in a table for each case, for each algorithm
